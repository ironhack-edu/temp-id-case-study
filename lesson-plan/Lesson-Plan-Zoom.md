# Lesson Plan - CSS|Advanced Selectors (Zoom Session)

:clock10: Lesson Duration: 2 hours

> Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to <b> Consolidate the learning from the Online Lesson </b> completed by the students before this Zoom session and prepare them to the final part of the course, where they will need to submit their individual work to the Ironhack lab.

---
### Learning Goals (reminder)

After this lesson, students should be able to:

- Select elements using basic selectors
- Select elements combining different selectors
- Select elements based on their relationship to other elements
- Select elements based on their attributes

### Setup

- Make sure you have the latest version of Zoom installed on your machine
- Have all the polls/Quizzes/interactions/breakout rooms ready in the backend 
- Test your microphone and webcam
- Find a quiet space with a simple background to avoid user's distraction
- Have the links to CodePen and other sites ready
- Make sure your material (including slides) works and have the "cheat-sheet" document for the students prepared

### Trainer Tips
Please access the 'Train the trainer' Ironhack module to review our training framework and make sure your session is aligned with it. Some additional key aspects to consider are:

👉 ENGAGEMENT
- Adapt to the class. When asking questions, you will observe the understanding of the group and they may bring really interesting points that were not part of your agenda. Please try to continue the session building on their answers so they can feel they are listened.
- Allow time for discussion. Very often learning takes place when people exchange their views on a subject. Nourish those exchanges and ask them to comment on other student's ideas (always with respect, of course)

👉 CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING
- Use the quick polls to easily check the understanding of the lesson
- Go into each 'Breakout Room' to ask how the activity is going and if they need any help
- Notice if the "quiet students" are actually working on the task on CodePen

👉 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
- Bring websites/projects you have worked in the past
- Use of OpenSource active platforms

👉 LEARNING ACTIVITIES
- Zoom Polls
- Zoom Breakout rooms
- Code Pen exercises
- Working by pairs: Using your real-world project or the Star Wars Dark Mode CodePen page
- (optional) Quiz race using Kahoot or MyQuiz

### Part 1 - Recap

> :clock10: 30 min

❓  1) Launch the Initial Zoom Polls (P1 how did they find the Online Lesson?, P2 did they access the CodePen links?) - The results will give you an initial idea of the level of the class and how long you may spend in the CodePen examples

🗒️  2) Review concepts by sharing the "cheat-sheet" on your screen with all the codes covered in the Online Lesson. Ask the group to use the raise the hand button to answer and unmute their mics. If you see they don't use the button, explain they can also submit the answer in the chat window.

🎙️  3) Ask if they have any questions about the Online Lesson - explain they can freely unmute themselves to comment/discuss.

🖥️  4) Review in Group the CodePen activity Selecting Adjacent Siblings so everybody can test accessing to the site on their devices before the main activity that will take place by pairs later

### Part 2 - Hands on

> :clock10: 1h


📜  5) Group Activity using slides (3 snippets of CSS code): showing the snippets of the code you prepared, ask to identify all the advanced selectors used in it. After a bit of discussion, reveal the answer highligthing every single one and move to the next snippet.

💻  6) Working by pairs - using Zoom breakout rooms + CodePen
- Activty 1 (class divided by pairs and breakout rooms): ask to add 5 more languages to the list and use whichever selectors they may want just to play and show they can work with them in the code. Link: https://codepen.io/abernier/embed/NWKmera?height=485&theme-id=0&default-tab=html,result

(bring the students back to the main Zoom session to explain the instructions for the second activity)

- Activity 2: (again the breakout rooms) Using the 'real-live example' you brought (or using the Star Wars CodePen by JOSH https://codepen.io/spamgoblin/pen/VwbByXM)
Ask them to modify the CSS to get it similar to X (screenshot of the final look of the site you want the students to replicate) 
Check on each room, ask if they need help and suggest options accordingly.

- Quick presentation: at the end of Activity 2, bring them all back to the main Zoom session and ask them to share their screens with the group to show the results of their work with them. Ask them about their biggest challenges for the task.

❔ (optional) 7) Run a "quiz race" using Kahoot, MyQuiz or similar for learners to identify selectors used in the lesson. This is an optional activity if you need to complete the duration of the lesson and it enables some fun competition amongst the students.


### Part 3 - Questions and Next Steps

> :clock10: 20 min

Ask if there are any questions about the content covered today

Introduce the next and final activity of the course, which it's an individual task to be completed by every student within one week. As usual, they will find all the required information in the <b>Github IronHack lab </b>. Please share the specific link to it and remind them of the usual fork-pull request process to submit their projects.

Link to the lab: [https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-xxxxxxxxxxxxx)

Explain that they can contact you or the Ironhack supporting team via the standard channels and they can also use the Forum to exchange ideas (this could be a dedicated Ironhack Community platform, a Slack channel, etc.)

Many thanks for your work and good luck! 🙂 👋
