# Lesson Plan | CSS Advanced Selectors

## Description

In this lesson students will learn about different CSS selectors through adding them to a simple HTML file containing different elements they produced as a pre-work. Students will be introduced to basic and advanced selectors in a guided, step by step manner, gaining understanding of when to use each of them and why.

Students will then carry out some work individually, exploring and experimenting with the selectors they have learnt about as well as some new ones and then have a short exchange with a partner to describe the state of their transformed HTML file with a range of CSS selectors.

The lesson will then have a reflection and discussion period, to summarize the key learnings and situate the topic within its broader context, providing real-world examples. The lesson will then close by communicating the next steps and including a task, self-assessment exercise and short quiz.

## Objectives & Learning Goals

This lesson should provide students with a base knowledge of CSS selectors, what they are, how they are implemented and why. A broader goal is to communicate the importance of keeping HTML as tidy, clean, and compact as possible.

The learning goals for the lesson are as follows:

- Understand why selectors are used in CSS
- Understand when to use different selectors and why
- Select elements using basic selectors
- Select elements combining different selectors
- Select elements based on their relationship to other elements
- Select elements based on their attributes

## Duration

A recommendation for the duration of a session approximately 2 hours as this gives sufficient time to create an output and to allow for breaks and to deal with unforeseen circumstances that could result in losing time (such as connection problems in the case of an online session) or extended discussions.

## Pre-lesson Preparation

Students are required to carry out a task before the lesson to refresh their knowledge on the document tree in the Document Object Model. The task will form the basis for the HTML page they will add CSS selectors to throughout the lesson, and should take between 30 mins and 1 hour. The aim of the pre-work is to encourage students to have a personal connection and ownership of their work.

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with HTML basics and have an idea about how CSS works.

## Delivery Format & Recommendations

The lesson may be delivered with the main instructor and teaching assistant, for approximately 20 students. The instructor will carry out the main activities in a guided, step by step format whilst sharing their screen if carried out online. The students can then either choose to follow the instructor and go between Zoom and their own browser, or have both open in a dual screen setup (recommended).

## Schedule

Note the different [interaction modes](https://github.com/ollie-j-j/temp-id-case-study/blob/oj-ironhack-case-study/instructor-resources/instructor-guidelines-general.md) used for each section for recommendations on how the content is best delivered.

### Introduction & Recap [Presentation Mode] - 10'

The aim of this section is to:

- Connect content to previous lesson
- Recap on document trees
- Present learning goals of the lesson
- Short introduction to what CSS Selectors are
- Ask if there are questions on the content so far
- Talk through lesson schedule

### Pre-work Review [Discussion Mode] - 5'

This section serves as a brief check in with students:

- Answer questions about the pre-work
- Student volunteer to show their pre-work to the class

When evaluating the pre-work, look for a variety of HTML elements that are used, and have the example ready to show if necessary.

### Guided Examples [Workshop Mode] - 40'

In this section the instructor will talk through the different selector examples in the documentation. The instructor should be sharing their screen for the duration of this section, talking through the example links and showing the codepen examples for each selector. Throughout this section, students should be working on their own pages, adding each selector as it is discussed to their pages. The teaching assistant will be important in this section to answer on the fly questions from students.

Depending on how the students are receiving the information, after the basic selectors section it might be worth taking a 5 minute break before the advanced selectors to reduce information overload.

### Break - 10’

### Experimenting with Selectors [Studio Mode] - 25'

By this stage, students should have an overview of the different types of CSS selectors. The aim of this section is for them to carry on experimenting with the selectors in a self-led fashion. They should add more to their page, using the different documentation links to explore new ones. The aim here is to encourage students to discover topics for themselves, and understand that the lessons serve as an entry point to a topic, and further exploration and practice is needed to develop literacy and deeper understanding.

The instructor and teaching assistant should be on-hand to answer questions as they arise, taking on the roles as facilitators. If there is a question that would be useful for everyone to be aware of, or it’s clear that a particular selector needs some more explanation then it might be worth explaining it to the whole class.

### Student Exchange [Studio Mode] - 10'

The aim of this section is to encourage peer learning, collaboration and communication skills. Students will form in pairs and talk through their pages with each other, explaining the different CSS selectors they have used, and articulating why they have used a particular one. The idea is also for students to learn from each other, and become accustomed to explaining the choices they have made, and how different parts of their code work.

### Reflection & Discussion [Discussion Mode] - 15'

The aim of this section is to:

- Provide a summary of what has been covered in the class
- Evaluate key learnings by returning to the learning goals
- Answer questions about any of the topics that arose in the lesson
- Provide and discuss real-world examples to contextualise topic

### Next Steps & Closing [Presentation Mode] - 5'

This section should wrap up the lesson, answer any final questions and introduce the topic for the next lesson and any tasks to be completed. Students will have to continue with their pages and experimenting with selectors, complete the self-evaluation and a short quiz to test their knowledge on CSS selectors.

## Engagement Strategies

In order to maintain the focus and attention of students, a range of interaction modes are used in the lesson. The aim is to reduce one-directional communication from the instructor to students and allow the instructor to act as a facilitator, assisting the students with their own projects.

During the guided section where students follow along with the instructor step-by-step, it is important to continually check-in with students to ask how they are receiving the content and its pace of delivery. What is important is that students don’t feel left behind, so if a student prefers to listen first and apply the selectors independently, they are able to do that after the break during the “Experimenting with Selectors” section.

To check for understanding in this section, the instructor may call on a volunteer to share their screen to share how they have implemented a particular selector in their page. In a remote context where it is more difficult to gauge how students are receiving information, encourage students to ask questions in the Zoom chat.

## Remote Considerations

In addition to [general remote considerations](https://github.com/ollie-j-j/temp-id-case-study/blob/oj-ironhack-case-study/instructor-resources/instructor-guidelines-general.md), for this lesson as discussed it is important to encourage students to communicate if a particular concept needs repeating by asking them to write in the Zoom chat. Additional breaks may also be required, such as in between the basic and advanced selectors. The best way to know is to ask the students if they would like a break or not in.

During the “Experimenting with Selectors”, students are free to turn off their cameras and work independently, but the instructor should be available for any questions. During the “Student Exchange” where students will work in pairs, it might be worth preparing Zoom breakout rooms before the session to save time.

## Assessment Tools

The instructor has 3 assessment tools to check for student understanding which can be evaluated after the lesson.

### Task - Simple page with CSS Selectors

The page that students will create may be evaluated during the class as well as afterwards once it has been completed. The instructor can use the following criteria to check if the content has been applied to the project:

- Basic selectors implemented into page correctly
- Advanced implemented into page correctly
- New selectors that were not presented in class implemented into page correctly

### Self-assessment

The self-assessment in Miro is used to provide an overview of how the content has been received during the class. Depending on the results, the instructor may decide to recap a particular selector or concept in the following lesson. This should also encourage the students to reflect on the concepts they should focus on after the class.

### Quiz

The short quiz focuses on testing knowledge of which CSS selectors are used and knowledge of the correct syntax. The quiz should provide insight into how accustomed students are with using different types of selectors and their qualities.

## Reflection

Once the class has ended, it is important for the instructor to note down anything that worked particularly well during the lesson or that did not work so well. This can help inform the next iteration of the class, and better understand which engagement strategies work over others for future lessons and topics.

The following questions can serve as a starting point:

- Were there any technical issues in your class?
- What worked well in the lesson?
- What could be improved in the lesson?
- Is there anything that would have made the lesson run more smoothly?
