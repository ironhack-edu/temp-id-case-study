# Instructor Guidelines | General

This document serves as a general guide that can be applied to different lessons. The content acts as a base that can be iterated, adapted and remixed depending on the requirements of a given subject.

## Lesson Format

The exact format of each lesson will depend on its content and learning objectives, but as a guide lessons may contain the following core components:

### Pre-work

- This happens before the session, so students enter with a basic understanding of what they will be doing in the session
- Task to be completed before the lesson
- This could include reading, videos, lectures

### Introduction

- Connect topic to previous lesson
- Any initial questions and doubts from the students can be answered
- The intention of the activity is described and what the desired end goal and key learnings will be
- The agenda of the session will be described (including breaks)
- The roles of the instructors will be described, so students know who to ask and if they have questions (this is especially important for online sessions)
- For online sessions, the connection rules will be communicated e.g. make sure to be on mute when not talking
- Check everyone has the tools/software needed to carry out the workshop (this will also be communicated times before the workshop)

### Main activity

- Guided instructional where tutors go step by step through an activity with the whole class
- Screen sharing is recommended for students to be able to follow what the instructor is doing
- Breaks are needed to keep students engaged and provide a chance to solve potential problems which stop the student from being able to follow

### Reflection

- Chance to evaluate learnings and get a sense of what students have understood from the sessions
- Discuss how the lesson content can be applied to their own project
- Discussion can be opened up to relate the topic to the lives and final project of the students
- Contextualise the topic/technology being discussed
- Guided by the instructor but can be free-flowing depending on the students’ engagement and the questions and issues they raise

### Problem Solving

- Any problems that students have can be resolved in this period
- Time is given at the end of the guided component where students can finish the task
- Support offered for those that need it, and can be organised and coordinated as a class as potentially many students encounter the same problem
- A small dynamic can be carried out to find the important issues to go through at the beginning of this session

### Next Steps

- The session is wrapped up and closed with any final questions being answered
- The readings, any outstanding tasks and topics for the next session will be communicated and shared

## Interaction Modes

For each lesson there may be different modes of interaction, depending on the nature of the content and the desired input and output from students. Using a variety of interaction modes during the class may help engage students and a variety of learning styles. The idea is that they can all be used within a given lesson, to help structure the lesson and provide students with different ways of interacting with the instructor and their peers for more engagement and active learning.

These interaction modes include presentation mode, workshop mode, discussion mode and studio mode.

### Presentation Mode

- One-directional lecture from instructor
- Instructor shares screen
- Minimal interaction from students

### Workshop Mode

- Hands-on activity
- Can be guided session or involve group work
- Instructor shares screen
- Active involvement and participation from students

### Discussion Mode

- Class-wide discussions
- May include students presenting work
- Troubleshooting certain topics and concepts

### Studio Mode

- “Connected” working - students working on a task independently or in groups
- Instructor available to answer questions and facilitate

## Remote considerations

Delivering content in a remote context often requires more planning than in-person lessons. There are also certain technical issues to be aware of which can impact the quality of the lesson and how students receive content. Considerations to be aware of may be summarised as:

- Ask students to connect to the Zoom/video call link 5 minutes before to ensure class starts on time
- More breaks needed than in-person lessons - 5 minutes every 30 minutes of content can be used as a rule of thumb, as well as asking students
- Check-in with students more often and take extra care that they are following the lesson, especially in guided activities
- Encourage students to ask questions in the Zoom chat
- All students should be on mute unless they are talking to ensure no background noise
- Extra monitor recommended, so students can follow the instructors screen and use another for their own work
- Use a quiet room with carpet if possible to reduce echo
- Sit in front of natural light if possible, or place a lamp behind the screen to illuminate the face and avoid contrast with the background
- Try to use a plain and light background and contrast with dark clothing
