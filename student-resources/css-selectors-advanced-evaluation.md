# Evaluation | CSS Advanced Selectors

## Description

There will be three different ways that the topic of CSS Advanced Selectors will be evaluated: a task, a self-assessment exercise and short quiz.

## Task

The task will be started before the lesson in the form of some pre-work, which involves making a simple HTML file with the knowledge about HTML and CSS you have acquired so far. In the lesson, this file will be used to learn about the different CSS selectors. After the lesson you will then continue your experimentation and learning about CSS selectors using the same page in order to build up your confidence with this topic.

## Self-Assessment

After the class, you will be asked fill in a canvas in [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l13ohFs=/) to reflect on which learning goals you feel most and least confident with. This will give the instructor an idea as the overall level of the class and if anything should be covered in the next lesson.

## Quiz

Finally, you will be asked to complete a [short quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yprhnOKxS7Lx-Qq96VUtDNx4j5fS-W96CCQyaJsA8cA/edit), covering some of the basic knowledge you will have built up over CSS selectors!
