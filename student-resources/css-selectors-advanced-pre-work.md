# Pre-Work | CSS Advanced Selectors

## Introduction

This pre-work is designed so you get the most out of the CSS Advanced Selectors class, and to contextualise this topic with what you have learnt so far. As you know, we use CSS to bring HTML to life and make it more visually appealing. We can use CSS selectors, to select different HTML elements by class, type, ID and attribute - during the class you will see why this is useful to create organized and clear code.

Before we go into that though, it will be useful to review the work you have done on the document tree in the Document Object Model as if you understand the document tree concept, then CSS selectors will be much easier to understand and therefore apply. In the first part of this task, you will spend some time refreshing the Document Object Model and then you will create a simple HTML page which will act as a base to add the different CSS Selectors that you will learn.

## Duration

This task should take between 30 mins and 1 hour.

## Reading

If you need to refresh your knowledge of the DOM, have a read through these links:

- [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)
- [How whitespace is handled by HTML, CSS, and in the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Whitespace)
- [What is the HTML DOM?](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp)

## Task

The brief for this project is to create a simple HTML page with your ‘Top 3’ of a topic of your choosing. This could be top 3 sports, books, holiday destination - it could be anything, the choice is yours!

The page can be as long or short as you like, what is important is that you include a number and variety of different HTML elements to structure your page. For instance your page could feature:

- Main page heading
- A few short paragraphs
- Headings with different sizes
- A few lists

Take a look at the [HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) reference to remind yourself of some of the elements you could use.

Create this file locally on your computer and bring it to the class tomorrow. Remember to use the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section to link the stylesheet in the HTML file as you will be writing your CSS in a separate file.
